# Flot Selection Plugin (with draggable endpoints)

The existing Flot selection plugin clears your existing selection any time you
click and drag on the map again.

This library patches the current selection tool to force you to modify an
existing selection. It's designed to be used with graphs that would be invalid
in the absence of a selection of some time range.
